<h1>Your Rights — Clear, Calm, Lawful</h1>
<p class="intro">
  This page exists to take the fear out of the unknown.
  Once you understand where the real boundaries are, most of the pressure begins to lift.
</p>

<h2>Home Education Is a Legal Right</h2>
<p>
  In the UK, parents are responsible for their child’s education — not the local authority.
  You can educate your child at home without needing to ask permission, and you do not need to
  follow the national curriculum or mimic school.
</p>
<div class="pullout">
  The law protects your freedom to home educate.
  Councils can ask for information, but you choose the format, level of detail and method of delivery.
</div>

<div class="label" style="margin-top:24px;">What councils can request</div>
<h2>Reasonable Evidence of Education</h2>
<p>
  A local authority may make informal enquiries to satisfy itself that your child is receiving an education suitable for their age, ability and needs.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can respond in writing — this is the most common and safest method.</li>
  <li>You decide the structure and level of detail.</li>
  <li>You are not required to send daily work or extensive samples.</li>
  <li>You are not required to permit home visits.</li>
</ul>

<div class="label" style="margin-top:24px;">What councils cannot demand</div>
<h2>Your Boundaries Are Protected</h2>
<p>
  Many parents feel pressured because they receive requests that go far beyond what the law requires.
  Knowing the limits removes most of the fear.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Councils cannot insist on a home visit.</li>
  <li>Councils cannot demand all of your child’s work.</li>
  <li>Councils cannot require school-style testing or assessment.</li>
  <li>Councils cannot threaten a School Attendance Order without clear evidence of unsuitable education.</li>
</ul>
