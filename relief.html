<h1>Here’s Why It Felt Different</h1>
<p class="intro">

  parents begin to doubt themselves — and that doubt is what creates the knot in your stomach,
  not the law itself.

<div class="pullout">
  This toolkit is built to give you one thing you may not have had for a while:
  a place where nothing is rushed, nothing is demanded, and everything is explained plainly and lawfully.

<h2>Your Three Safety Nets</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Your Rights</strong> — a calm, factual summary of what councils can and cannot ask for.</li>
  <li><strong>Learning Statement Builder</strong> — a guided way to respond in writing without oversharing.</li>
  <li><strong>Evidence Vault</strong> — a private log of learning kept on your own device.</li>
</ul>

  The next step takes you to your Anchor Space — your steady point whenever you need it.
