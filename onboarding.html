<h1>Home Education Needs Clarity — Not Pressure</h1>
<p class="intro">
  Many home-educating parents have experienced increasing requests for information from their local authority.
  Sometimes those requests feel bigger than expected and create stress and uncertainty.
  This toolkit exists to bring things back to clear ground.
</p>

<h2>You’re in the Right Place</h2>
<p>
  You haven’t done anything wrong. You’re not behind. You’re not failing.
  You are a parent taking responsibility for your child’s education in a lawful way.
  This space is here to support that — calmly, without confrontation.
</p>

<h2>What You’ll Find Here</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A clear, calm understanding of what councils can ask for — and what they cannot demand.</li>
  <li>A guided way to write a learning statement that is safe and compliant.</li>
  <li>A private vault to record your own evidence on your device.</li>
</ul>

<div class="pullout">
  Everyone who uses this toolkit starts from the same place:
  a calm explanation, then steady tools, then a home base you can return to.
</div>

<p style="margin-top:20px;">
  When you’re ready, continue to the next step. There is no rush.
