  <li>Parents — not the local authority — are responsible for a child’s education (Education Act 1996, Section 7).</li>
  <li>You do not need permission to home educate.</li>
  <li>You are not required to follow the national curriculum.</li>
  <li>You may provide information in writing; this is fully valid.</li>
  <li>Councils cannot require home visits unless there is a safeguarding concern.</li>
  <li>Councils may only issue a School Attendance Order if they have strong evidence that education is unsuitable — not simply due to missing paperwork.</li>
